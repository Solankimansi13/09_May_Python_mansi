18. What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 

- A tuple is a collection of objects that are ordered and immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. 
- Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

Here are the main differences between lists and tuples:

List:

- Ordered collection of objects
- Mutable (can be changed after creation)
- Defined using square brackets []
- Elements can be added, removed, or modified

Tuple:

- Ordered collection of objects
- Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
- Defined using parentheses ()
- Elements cannot be added, removed, or modified

-  example of creating a list and a tuple:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # List
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Tuple


Some key benefits of tuples include:

- Immutable, which means they cannot be changed accidentally or maliciously
- Can be used as keys in dictionaries
- Can be used in sets
- Are more memory-efficient than lists

limitation of tuple .

- Cannot be modified after creation
- Cannot be extended or shrunk
