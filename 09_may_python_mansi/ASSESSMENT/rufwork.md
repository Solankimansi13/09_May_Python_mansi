1. Write a program to demonstrate the Python E-Note Book Console based 
application 
2.  Prepare demonstration of Python E-Note Book under software
development principles and follow coding protocols
3.  In this application 3 operations involved (generate note, view note)
4. Execution of the code following menu must be displayed.
5. Make sure each business logic is denoted with appropriate comments and
make your code interactive and represent clean and clear output on your
console screen.
output will look like this:-

            welcome to python E - Note

            press 1 for genrate note
            press 2 for view note
            press 4 for Exit 

Enter your choice: 

6.  when user select option 1 then accept following details from user 

out put will look like this :

        welcome to python E - Note

            press 1 for genrate note
            press 2 for view note
            press 4 for Exit 

        Enter your choice: 1
        Enter pyrhon e note genrator name : anjli patel
        enter python e- note book titile: python introduction
        enter e note content :python higher level programing language 

7. user can add notes, view all notes, and exit from the system
8.  Accept all values dynamically from user
9.  Store all notes in files 
10.  Make sure this code implements using file handling concept 
11. create separate file for all business logics and make them reusable - use
modules concepts for implements above logic

After each operations always display menu:

for example like this:-
            welcome to python E - Note

                     press 1 for genrate note
                     press 2 for view note
                     press 4 for Exit 

            Enter your choice: 1
            Enter pyrhon e note genrator name : 898
            invalid input
            enter python e- note book titile: 
            enter e note content :


12. Make sure validation proper given – each options - display appropriate
message if user enter invalid input and accept values again and - use
looping concepts and string inbuilt methods concepts in this logic
implementation
13.  Make sure code prevent from unexpected exception return to the previous
menu and accept all details again.

After entered notes output must be like following:

for example i am giving a dummy entery so you can understan
output:-

            note genrator: anjali patel
14. Generate a log file and store all transaction details in that log file.
15.  After each selection menu must be displayed asking for user input
16.  After execution of each option confirmation message must be displayed.
17.  Program should not be terminated till the user Exit it
